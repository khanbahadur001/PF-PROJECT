Project: Library Management System

Course: Programming Fundamentals — Mini Project
Date: January 2026

Team Members and Roles
- Yaseen Ahmad Khan Wazir — Group Leader (Menu & Interface, integration)
- Hafsa Urooj — Core Logic (data structures and operations)
- Khan Bahadur — File I/O & Persistence (load/save, parsing)
- Marukh Qamar — Documentation & Testing

Project Summary
This project implements a menu-driven Library Management System in C++ demonstrating core programming fundamentals taught in the course. The system supports adding, viewing, searching, updating, and deleting books. Data persistence is provided using a simple pipe-separated text file (`library.txt`).

Functional Requirements Covered
- User input and output via console
- Conditional statements and switch-case menu
- Loops for iterating over collections
- Functions for modular code (add, display, search, update, delete)
- Use of arrays/lists: `std::vector<Book>`
- File handling: `loadLibrary()` and `saveLibrary()` in `fileio.cpp`
- Input validation and error handling (numeric checks, range checks)
- Menu-driven program flow with save-on-exit

Design Notes
- Data model: `Book` struct (`book.h`) with `bookID`, `title`, `author`, `quantity`.
- Persistence format: `bookID|title|author|quantity` per line in `library.txt`.
- Team workflow: Each member worked on a separate branch and made multiple meaningful commits. See `CONTRIBUTORS.md` and `docs/commit_examples.md` for the commit history and branch naming guidelines.

How to Run
From `src` folder compile with:
g++ main.cpp fileio.cpp -o library.exe
Run `library.exe` to start. The program will attempt to load `library.txt` from the same folder.
